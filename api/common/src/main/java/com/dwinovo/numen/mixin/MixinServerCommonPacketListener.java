/**
 * Drop every outbound packet aimed at a companion {@link FakeConnection}, at the
 * <em>packet-listener</em> level — one layer above {@link FakeConnection#send} — after
 * offering it to the body's {@link com.dwinovo.numen.entity.FakeClient}, which answers the
 * handshakes the server would otherwise wait on forever and hands what the server says to her
 * (system chat and the action bar) to the model.
 *
 * <h2>Why this is needed on top of {@code FakeConnection.send} being a no-op</h2>
 * NeoForge inserts its custom-payload channel validation
 * ({@code NetworkRegistry.checkPacket}) <em>inside</em>
 * {@link ServerCommonPacketListenerImpl#send}, which runs <strong>before</strong> the
 * call reaches {@link Connection#send}. So a companion's no-op {@code Connection.send}
 * never gets the chance to discard a modded clientbound payload — the validation throws
 * first:
 * <pre>UnsupportedOperationException: Payload &lt;mod:foo&gt; may not be sent to the client!</pre>
 * A fake player never negotiated any custom channels (it skips the configuration phase),
 * so the channel set is empty and <em>any</em> mod custom payload trips the check and
 * crashes the server tick. This happens for any mod that pushes a clientbound payload at
 * the body — an item's {@code use()} opening a screen (chiikawa's music box), a menu's
 * per-tick {@code broadcastChanges} (AE2 terminals), etc.
 *
 * <p>Cancelling at {@code HEAD} of the 2-arg {@code send(Packet, PacketSendListener)} short-circuits
 * before its {@code checkPacket}. Every send goes through that overload — the 1-arg {@code send(Packet)}
 * only forwards to it, and callers that want a delivery listener (a system chat message's
 * "not delivered" fallback) call it directly — so it is the one exit, and the only place the fake client
 * sees every packet. It is a strict superset of what {@link FakeConnection#send} already did (drop on the
 * floor — there is no client), so there is no behavioural regression: vanilla position/chunk/keep-alive
 * packets were already discarded.
 *
 * <p>Common (all environments): the integrated server hits this path in singleplayer too,
 * so it must NOT be a {@code server}-only (dedicated) mixin.
