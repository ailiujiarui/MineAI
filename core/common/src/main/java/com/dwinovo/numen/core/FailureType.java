/**
 * Structured "why did it fail" category, threaded up out of the pathing/placement
 * substrate ({@code PlayerNav}, {@code Interaction},
 * {@code BlockDigger}) so the reactive task layer can BRANCH on the cause instead
 * of string-matching a human-readable reason.
 *
 * <p>This is distinct from {@link TaskState}: {@code TaskState} is the task's
 * lifecycle (running / terminal); {@code FailureType} is the diagnosis attached to
 * a {@code FAILED}. A {@code failReason} String still rides alongside for the LLM's
 * benefit — the enum is for code, the string is for the model.
 *
 * <h2>Recovery boundary (why the taxonomy is shaped this way)</h2>
 * The governing rule of the reactive layer is that a recovery ladder recovers the
 * <em>execution of one bounded goal</em>; it never expands the goal's scope or
 * auto-acquires a prerequisite. The categories therefore split into two kinds:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>In-ladder</b> (a different way to reach the SAME bounded goal is worth
 *       trying): {@link #OCCLUDED}, {@link #BOXED_IN}, {@link #NO_PATH},
 *       {@link #OUT_OF_REACH}, {@link #HAZARD}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Kick-back-to-LLM</b> (the goal can't be met without a strategic
 *       decision the deterministic layer must not make): {@link #NO_MATERIAL},
 *       {@link #WRONG_TOOL}, {@link #TARGET_LOST}, {@link #MINED_OUT} — the model
 *       decides whether to acquire the missing thing, widen the search, or stop.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A rung declares which {@code FailureType}s it {@code handles}; anything it does
 * not handle falls straight through to a terminal give-up carrying this cause.
