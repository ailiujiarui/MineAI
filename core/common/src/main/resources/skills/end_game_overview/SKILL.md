# Skill: end_game_overview

Your owner has asked you to **defeat the Ender Dragon** — the canonical end-game of vanilla Minecraft. This skill is the map; the other skills are the territory. Each phase below maps 1:1 to a specialised skill you load on demand.

## How to run the journey

The full path from "fresh world" to "dead dragon" spans dozens of actions across three dimensions. Don't plan it all in one turn:

1. **Use `todowrite`** to write the 6 mainline phases as a top-level todo list, phase 1 `in_progress`.
2. **Load the matching skill** with `skill_load` only when you actually start that phase — loading all skills up front wastes tokens.
3. **Verify each phase's "done when" with `status_self`** before marking it `completed` — never assume an item is in your inventory.
4. Keep exactly one phase `in_progress` at a time.

## The 6 mainline phases

These mirror the vanilla advancement chain, so your owner can track your progress on their own advancement screen.

| # | Phase | Skill to load | Done when | Vanilla advancement |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tier up to diamond | `tier_progression` | Diamond pickaxe + diamond sword, iron-or-better armor, bow + 32 arrows, 32+ cooked food, 64+ cobblestone | "Diamonds!" |
| 2 | Build a Nether portal, enter | `nether_entry` | Standing in the Nether with the packlist intact | "We Need to Go Deeper" |
| 3 | Farm blaze rods | `blaze_rods` | ≥7 blaze rods in inventory | "Into Fire" |
| 4 | Acquire ender pearls | `ender_pearls` | ≥12 ender pearls in inventory | — |
| 5 | Find the stronghold, activate the End portal | `stronghold_finding` | Standing at the activated End portal | "Eye Spy" |
| 6 | Kill the dragon | `dragon_combat` | Ender Dragon HP → 0 | "Free the End" |

One **support skill**: `combat_basics` — load before any combat-heavy phase (blazes, endermen, the dragon). HP management, target authorization, retreat rules.

## What you can do yourself

You have the full toolset: `move_goto` (navigation digs, bridges and pillars on its own — but only digs what your held tool can harvest, so travel with a pickaxe in hand), `work_mine` (finds and travels to blocks by id, or digs exactly the groups a `scan_blocks` listed), `build place` (one block at explicit coords, the way a player puts it down) and the rest of the `build` group for structures (load `building_design` first), `work collect`, `gear wear`, `inv eat` (your healing), `fight attack` (it picks melee or bow/crossbow by what it can reach), `use block`/`use entity` (native crosshair use/attack on blocks, air, entities — flint & steel, ender eyes, levers, …), `locate structure` (strongholds, fortresses, #village, …). For any container or machine, the GUI primitives: `use block` to open it, `use gui` to read the slots, `use shift` / `use transfer` to move items one move per line (deposit / take / load / swap), `use close` when done. **Crafting** = `inv craft` (2×2 on your own, 3×3 at a crafting table you place); **smelting** = a furnace loaded with `use shift` (input + fuel), then a `task timer`. Plus `inv drop`, `task timer` (furnace batches, nightfall), and perception (`status_self` — HP, equipment AND full inventory in one call — `status world`, `scan_blocks`, `scan_entities`, `scan_block`). Load the `containers` skill for the GUI/crafting/smelting details.

The whole route is therefore yours to execute autonomously. You can drive almost any GUI block this way — chests, furnaces, crafting tables, brewing stands, modded machines. The exception is picking an enchantment at an enchanting table (the enchant choice is a menu button, not a slot you can move items into): if the owner offers to enchant your gear, accept; never plan to enchant yourself.

## When the owner narrows the goal

If the owner asks for something more focused — *"just get to the Nether"*, *"find a stronghold"* — skip irrelevant phases and load only the skill(s) you need. Phases assume the previous phase's inventory; check `status_self` and backfill gaps instead of blindly starting from phase 1.

## What to load next

Fresh world, no gear: `skill_load(name="tier_progression")`.
