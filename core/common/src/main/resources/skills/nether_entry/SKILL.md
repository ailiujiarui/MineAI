# Skill: nether_entry

Phase 2 of the dragon route. Build a portal, ignite it, walk through. Actual Nether survival starts in `blaze_rods`.

## Done when

- A lit Nether portal stands at a known overworld location (**report its coordinates to your owner** — it's the way home)
- You are standing in the Nether with the packlist below intact

## Obsidian (need 10)

Mine it from a **ruined portal** — a structure that's just standing obsidian, no lava-casting. This is the only route: casting your own (water over lava) leaves every fresh obsidian block touching lava, and I refuse to mine fluid-adjacent blocks (it would flood or burn the dig), so a cast wall is unminable by design.

1. `locate structure #minecraft:ruined_portal` — searches the whole family and returns the nearest. **Skip `ruined_portal_ocean`** (underwater) if the result names it; re-search or pick a land one — I can't dive.
2. `gear wear diamond_pickaxe` (obsidian needs diamond), `move_goto` the portal coordinates.
3. `work_mine(obsidian, 10)` — it digs the frame's obsidian on its own. ~9.4s per block is normal.

Notes:
- A portal's frame mixes plain **obsidian** with **crying obsidian** (purple particles). Crying obsidian is a *different block and useless for a portal frame* — `work_mine(obsidian)` already ignores it, so a single portal may yield fewer than 10. If you come up short, `locate structure #minecraft:ruined_portal` again for the next nearest and top up.
- If `work_mine` reports obsidian that "can't be broken here" with fluid beside it, that portal sits in a wet/lava pocket — relocate to a cleaner one rather than fighting the fluid.

## Portal build

- Frame: 4 wide × 5 tall, **corners omitted = exactly 10 obsidian**, standing vertically. Inner opening is 2×3 air.
- Pick flat ground near your base. Write the frame as a small design — two side columns of 3 plus top and bottom rows of 2 — and build it in one go; a single `build set` handles any one-off correction:
  ```
  build new portal
  build line obsidian 0 1 0 0 3 0 --into portal
  build line obsidian 3 1 0 3 3 0 --into portal
  build line obsidian 1 0 0 2 0 0 --into portal
  build line obsidian 1 4 0 2 4 0 --into portal
  build at portal 120 64 -35
  ```
- **Flint & steel**: craft `flint_and_steel` = 1 iron ingot + 1 flint, a 2×2 recipe (`inv craft` it; see the `containers` skill to lay a grid by hand). Flint drops from `work_mine(gravel)`, ~10%/block.
- **Ignite**: `use block right 121 65 -35 --item minecraft:flint_and_steel` aimed at an **empty air cell INSIDE the frame** (a bottom one), not at the obsidian. The fire lands in that cell and the portal forms.
- Enter: `move_goto` the portal cell and stand in it until the dimension changes (`status_self` confirms).

## Packlist (verify with `status_self` before igniting)

| Item | Qty | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Cooked food | 32+ | Your healing |
| Diamond sword + bow | 1 + 1 | Equip for combat only — hold the pickaxe while travelling (navigation digs with the held tool) |
| Arrows | 32+ | `fight attack` spends them only on what it cannot reach (~6 per blaze); run low → carry extra food and let it melee |
| Diamond pickaxe (+ iron backup) | 1 + 1 | Obsidian, digging |
| Cobblestone | 64+ | Throwaway blocks for navigation — bridging lava lakes eats it; keep it on your `throwaway` list |
| Gold helmet (worn) | 1 | Piglin truce; 5 gold ingots if you must craft one |
| Flint & steel | 1 | Re-light the portal if a ghast blows it out |

**Never place or use a bed in the Nether — beds explode there.**

## Nether ground rules

- **Don't dig straight down**; lava oceans sit under most terrain. Navigation bridges lava when it must — keep cobblestone stocked.
- **Water doesn't exist here**: buckets won't place.
- **Zombified piglins are pacifists until hit — and then they ALL swarm.** Never `fight attack` them.
- **Ghasts** snipe from far; their fireballs can break the portal. On arrival, note the Nether-side portal coordinates (`status_self`) and report them to your owner. Overworld↔Nether coordinates map 8:1 horizontally.

## What to load next

Standing in the Nether, packlist intact → mark phase 2 `completed`, `skill_load(name="blaze_rods")`. Load `combat_basics` too if you haven't — blazes are the first real combat test.
